    <div class=" about_info"> <p>Hey, It's me, Mohammad Iztihad Rafid. I'm studying B.sc in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) in the most renowned University. <a class="nsu_link" href="http://www.northsouth.edu/">North South University (NSU)</a><br>I'm curious about new learning, dedicated and focused.
        I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide. </p> </div>
